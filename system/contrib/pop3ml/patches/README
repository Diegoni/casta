FIRST OF ALL SAVE YOUR DATA

- make a copy of your database with phpMyAdmin or mysql command-line tool with a row similar to:

admin@linux-peppe:/>mysqldump -u mysqluser --password=userpass pop3ml >/tmp/pop3ml.sql

- make a copy of your pop3ml folder

- edit /path/to/pop3ml/patches/sqlchanges and change LANG variable (default en-GB) if you are using italian language to:

  define('LANG','it-IT');

- run php patch script with your browser:

  http://localhost/pop3ml/patches/patch-0.1-0.2.php

- if all queries return no error and you have made changes to ml text files (ie. subscription text, welcome text,...)
  update 'mltable' 'language' field with old values in this way:

  if you want to update 'welcome' old value to new version, change the 'language' text part:

[[:SUBSCRIBE WELCOME=old text value :]]

 where '[[:' is the beginning of part
 'SUBSCRIBE WELCOME' is the language key
 '=' separator
 'old text value' the message text
 ':]]' the end of part

- edit all new fields and adjust their values as you like
